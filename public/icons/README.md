# Extension Icons

Place your extension icons here:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

These icons are used in the Chrome extension manifest and displayed in the browser's extension UI.

You can create simple icons or use an icon generator tool. For now, placeholder files are included, but you should replace them with actual icon images before publishing.
